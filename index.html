<p class="fontSizeLarger">The rain is a relentless, cold drumbeat against the windshield of your beat-up sedan. It's 2:17am and you've hopelessly lost on a gravel logging road that does not appear on any map. A frantic call from a distressed family member, you received moments before, drew you out here. However, you find that your phone is now drained of all its battery and the GPS in your car longer updates.</p>
<p class="fontSizeLarger">Through a brief break in the heavy downpour of rain, your headlights catch a flicker of light: a house. It's a two-story Victorian style home, standing defiant and crooked as it leans against the dense and tall <strong>Blackwood Forest</strong>, that surrounds the house. A single, dim lantern hangs on the porch. The alternative is spending the night in your cold car, that is on the verge of potentially sliding down a muddy embankment.</p>
