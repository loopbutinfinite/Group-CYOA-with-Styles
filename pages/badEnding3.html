<h1>Honk the Horn Repeatedly</h1>
<p>You lean on the horn, a long, blaring, desperate sound that cuts through the rain. The scratching stops immediately. The forest goes silent, save for the rain. Suddenly, the single light in the house goes out. A deep, guttural snarl erupts from the trees to your left, then another from your right. The horn worked, but not in the way you hoped. You've drawn attentionâ€”a lot of attention.</p>
<br>
<p>The snarls become footsteps, the sound of a dozen things breaking through the underbrush. They surround the car, their faces pressed against the glass. You try to drive, but they are too many, their strength too great. The last thing you see is the windshield splintering inward as dozens of hands and claws tear the roof off your sedan.</p>
