    <p class="fontSizeLarger">Your voice echoes in the stillness of the hall. A moment of silence. Then, a voice returns: warm, elderly, and slightly frail. "Oh, my dear! Come in, come in, let's get you out of the pouring rain! An old woman, bent with age, emerges from the kitchen. She has a kind face and quickly hands you a steaming mug of tea. She explains she's a hermit, her phone line down, but she has a CB radio in the basement of her home. She contacts a local tow company and even offers you a bed until they arrive in the morning</p>
    <p class="fontSizeLarger">You wake up in the morning and realize that you were just saved by a kind soul. The tow trucks arrives at dawn, you're back on the main highway by noon, and you've made an unlikely friend who sends you a Christmas card every year. The woods were only dangerous in your mind.</p>
