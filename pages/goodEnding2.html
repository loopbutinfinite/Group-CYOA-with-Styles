<h1>Good Ending #2</h1>
    <h2>Abandon the Car</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>You run toward the house, the light from its single lantern your beacon. The whispers behind you are growing louder, sounding less like wind and more like the synchronized chanting of a congregation. You reach the porch, throw the door open, and find the old woman from $\text{A-1}$ standing there, a silver crucifix in her hand. "Child!" she cries. "You brought them right to my door!" She ushers you in, slams the heavy door, and begins chanting a protective prayer in Latin.</p>
    <p>The woods' inhabitants beat against the house all night, but the old woman's faith and the house's ancient defenses hold. In the morning, they are gone. She explains the woods are protected by a malevolent force that respects boundaries. She helps you contact your family and arranges for a safe, discreet tow. You leave knowing there are true evils, but also true goodness, and you were protected by the latter.</p>
