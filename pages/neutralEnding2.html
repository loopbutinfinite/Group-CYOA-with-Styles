    <p class="fontSizeLarger">The engine roars to life. You slam the gear shifter into drive and slam on the accelerator. The car fishtails in the mud,
        barely gaining the needed traction to escape. The scratching from the trunk grows furious, and you hear a
        sickening <em>thump</em> against the back seat--it's trying to come through. Finally, your tires bite the
        gravel. You tear down the road, and the ferocious scratching sounds fade behind you. As you hit the highway miles later, you
        pull over, trembling at the though of what unknown could be lingering in your trunk. You muster the courage and open the trunk to find nothing but deep, crescent-shaped gouges in the sheet metal,
        and a single, <strong>petrified human finger</strong> lying on the trunk liner.</p>
    <p class="fontSizeLarger">You escape with your life and your freedom, but the horror and paranoia has followed you home. You'll spend every night
        checking your locks and jumping at every shadow. The discovery in your trunk is a permanent, macabre reminder of
        what lives in the <strong>Blackwood Forest</strong>. You never return to the house, and never speak of the
        finger to anyone.</p>
