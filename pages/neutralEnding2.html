    <h1>Turn on the Engine and Drive Away</h1>
    <h2>Neutral Ending #2</h2>
    <p>The engine roars to life. You slam the gear into drive and mash the accelerator. The car fishtails in the mud, barely gaining the needed traction to escape. The scratching from the trunk grows furious, and you hear a sickening <em>thump</em> against the back seat--it's trying to come through. Finally, your tires bite the gravel. You tear down the road, and the sounds of fury fade behind you. As you hit the highway miles later, you pull over, trembling. You open the trunk to find nothing but deep, crescent-shaped gouges in the sheet metal, and a single, <strong>petrified human finger</strong> lying on the trunk liner.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You escape with your life and your freedom, but the horror has followed you home. You'll spend every night checking your locks and jump at every shadow. The discovery in your trunk is a permanent, macabre reminder  of what lives in the <strong>Blackwood Forest</strong>. You never return to the house, and never speak of the finger to anyone.</p>
