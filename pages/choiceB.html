    <h1>Stay in the Car</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The hours crawl by. You drift in and out of a shallow, cold sleep, the wind rattling the car frame. Suddenly, a sound jolts you awake: <strong>scratching</strong>.It's coming from your trunk, just behind your seat. It's slow, deliberate, and sounds like something with long nails trying to work its way throught the thin metal that is your car door.</p>
    <h2>What do you do?</h2>
