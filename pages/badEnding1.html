<h1>Slip Inside Quietly</h1>
<p>You step inside. The air is deathly silent. You creep toward the only visible light source--a doorway at the end of the hall. As you pass a coat rack, your foot kicks something that skitters across the hardwood floor: a small, smooth doll's head. You freeze! You hear a sound from the room ahead: a gentle, repetitive <em>snip...snip...snip</em>. You press yourself against the wall and peer into the room. A figure is hunched over a work table, their back to you, meticulously stitching what looks like leather...or maybe <strong>skin</strong></p>
<br>
<p>The figure turns its head 180 degrees and smiles a sickeningly wide smile at you. The last thing you ever see is the glint of a needle and the reflection of your own paralyzed face in the polished glass eyes of the doll's head you'd kicked. You became a welcome addition to the 'family'.</p>
