<p class="fontSizeLarger">You step into the home. The air is deathly silent, the only sound you hear is the sound of your heartbeat. You creep toward the only visible light source--a doorway at the end of the hall. As you pass a coat rack, your foot kicks something that skitters across the hardwood floor; a small, smooth porcelain doll head. You freeze at the sight of it! Next thing you know, you hear a sound from the room ahead: a gentle, but repetitive <em>snip...snip...snip</em>. You press yourself against the wall and slowly peer into the room. A hooded figure draped in black cloth is hunched over a work table, their back to you, meticulously stitching what looks like leather...or maybe <strong>skin</strong></p>

<p class="fontSizeLarger">The hooded figure turns its head 180 degrees and makes a sickeningly wide smile at you. The last thing you ever see is the glint of a needle and the reflection of your own paralyzed face in the polished glass eyes of the doll's head you'd kicked. You became a welcome addition to the 'family'.</p>
