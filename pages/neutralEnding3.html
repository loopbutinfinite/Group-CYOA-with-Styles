    <h2>Neutral Ending 3</h2>
    <p class="fontSizeLarger">The whisper grows sharp and cold, a warning. But you're frustrated and soaked. You get the shovel and start digging the mud away from the tire. As you do, a thin, pale arm, unbelievably long, snakes out from the dark space between your car and the embankment. It wraps around your throat, not with force, but with a terrifying, gentle pressure. It starts to pull you down, not into the woods, but under the car, into the cold, liquid earth.</p>
    <p class="fontSizeLarger">You fight back with a scream, swinging the shovel blindly. You strike something hard, and the grip loosens. You scramble back, covered in mud and freezing. You run to the house, which you now see has a small, hand-painted sign by the porch that reads: 'Do Not Disturb the Soil.' You manage to use the home's working landline to call for help. You escape the woods, but you're now afraid of enclosed spaces and the feel of wet dirt. You were pulled back from the brink, but a part of you remains in the shadow of the earth.</p>
