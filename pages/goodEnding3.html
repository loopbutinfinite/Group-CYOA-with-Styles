<h1>Good Ending #3</h1>
    <h2>Call Out</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>"Who's there? I need help!" you shout into the dark. The whispering stops. You hear a new sound: a dry, scraping movement coming from the upper branches of the trees directly overhead. You shine your light up, and the beam catches something massive and pale, a shape that defies gravity, clinging to the branches. It lowers its head, and two black, dead eyes stare down at you. It lets out a sigh of pure, toxic regret.</p>
    <p>The creature does not move, but the eyes convey an overwhelming sense of ancient sorrow. It raises one long, skeletal finger and points directly down the road you just came from. You understand instantly: the house is not safe. You scramble back into the car, manage to rock it out of the mud, and drive back down the road as fast as the old engine will allow. You find a side road and drive until morning. The creature saved you, and you'll never know why, but the chilling memory of its sorrow convinces you that some things are better left alone. You get home safely, but forever carry the weight of that quiet, impossible encounter.</p>
