        title="leather-bound volume titled Blackwood Hymnal can be seen from a dirt stained window.">
    <p class="fontSizeLarger">You circle the house, flashlight in hand. You find a dirt-stained window on the ground floor slightly open.
        You raise it open and slip into the small, dusty room. You check your surroundings and see that the room may have once been used as a study. You see a book on a nearby table catch your gaze: a massive,
        leather-bound volume titled, <em>The Blackwood Hymnal</em>. You recognize the symbol on the cover--the same one
        on the locket your distressed family member always wore. Suddenly, the front door slams shut. You hear heavy
        footsteps start descending the staircase.</p>

    <p class="fontSizeLarger">You quickly grab the book and climb back out the window just as the footsteps reach the bottom of the stairs. You
        run, not stopping until you reach your car. You managae to dig it out just enough to drive, leaving the house
        behind. You escape the night, but you now possess a deeply disturbing, occult text that is somehow tied to your
        family; resting on the passenger seat of your car. You spend the rest of your life paranoid, wondering what you
        took and who will come to collect it.</p>
