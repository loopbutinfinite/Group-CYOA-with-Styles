    <h2>Neutral Ending 1</h2>
    <p>You circle the house, flashlight in hand. You find a dirt-stained window on the ground floor. It's slightly ajar. You push it open and slip into a small, dusty library. A book on a nearby table catches your eye: a massive, leather-bound volume titled, <em>The Blackwood Hymnal</em>. You rexognize the symbol on the cover--the same one on the locket your distressed family member always wore. Suddenly, the front door slams shut. You hear heavy footsteps start descending the staircase.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You quickly grab the book and climb back out the window just as the footsteps reach the bottom of the stairs. You run, not stopping until you reach your car. You managae to dig it out just enough to drive, leaving the house behind. You escape the night, but you now possess a deeply disturbing, occult text that is somehow tied to your family; resting on the passenger seat of your car. You spend the rest of your life paranoid, wondering what you took and who will come to collect it.</p>
