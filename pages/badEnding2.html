<h1>Brave It</h1>
<p>You grab the tire iron and unlock the driver's side door. As you step out, you shine your flashlight on the trunk. The scratching stops. You cautiously lift the trunk lid. The space is empty, save for your spare tire and your emergency kit. As you breathe a sigh of relief, you feel a massive, bony hand clamp over your mouth from behind. A high, dry laugh scrapes past your ear.</p>
<br>
<p>You were so focused on the trunk, you never considered what was waiting in the forest. It was a decoy. The tire iron slips from your numb fingers as you're dragged backward into the absolute darkness of the woods. Your car is found a month later, doors locked, battery dead, with a thin film of dust covering the seats. You are never found.</p>
