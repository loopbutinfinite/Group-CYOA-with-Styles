 // Challenge #1: Group Choose Your Own Adventure with CSS styles

 // Description: As a team, we created a Choose Your Own Adventure website text game with html and css. The project utilizes mulitples html pages for each part of the story and anchor tags to hyperlink through the pages.
                 We also included the use of image tags to include images into our pages and CSS classes to stylize our website with css classes that we call from a separate css file.
