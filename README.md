 // Challenge #1: Group Choose Your Own Adventure with CSS styles

 // Description: As a team, we created a Choose Your Own Adventure website text game with html and css. The project utilizes mulitples html pages for each part of the story and anchor tags to hyperlink through the pages.
                 We also included the use of image tags to include images into our pages and CSS classes to stylize our website with css classes that we call from a separate css file.

// Peer Review #1 (Daniel Herrera): I played with your HTML project and all your links work. The story is very intriguing and very detailed which kept me engaged into the story. The intro picture didn't load for me but the alternative text works describing what it should be; which is great! One thing I would recommend is centering your images. I think it would improve the UI if the image was centered and not placed towards the right of the screen. Otherwise, great Job!

//October 24, 2025 - Fixed the image centering issue as well as the image not loading in the introduction bug.
